abstract ={Inference for the population total from probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling provides a comparison of design-based and model-based approaches to survey inference, for an important practical design. The usual design-based approach weights sampled units by the inverse of their inclusion probabilities, using the Horvitz-Thompson or Hajek estimates. The model-based approach predicts the outcome for non-sampled units based on a regression of the outcome on the size variable. Zheng and Little (2003) showed that this regression approach, based on a flexible penalized spline regression model, can provide superior inferences to Horvitz-Thompson or generalized regression, in terms of both precision and confidence coverage. However, the sizes of non-sampled units are exploited in this approach, and this information is rarely included in public-use data files. Little and Zheng (2007) showed that when the sizes of non-sampled units are not available, the spline model, combined with a Bayesian bootstrap (BB) model for predicting the non-sampled sizes, can still provide superior inferences, though gains were reduced and less consistent. We further develop these methods by (a) including an unknown parameter to model heteroscedastic error variance in the spline model, an important modeling feature in the PPS setting; and (b) providing an improved Bayesian method for including summary information about the aggregate size of non-sampled units. Simulation studies suggest that the resulting Bayesian method, which includes information on the number and total size of the non-sampled units, recovers most of the information in the individual sizes of the non-sampled units, and provides significant gains over the traditional Horvitz-Thompson estimator. The method is applied to two public-use data sets from the U.S. Census Bureau as well as a data set from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.},

title = {MULTIPLE IMPUTATION IN TWO-STAGE CLUSTER SAMPLES USING THE WEIGHTED FINITE POPULATION BAYESIAN BOOTSTRAP},
year = {2016}, 
doi = {10.1093/jssam/smv031}, 
abstract ={Multistage sampling is often employed in survey samples for cost and convenience. However, accounting for clustering features when generating datasets for multiple imputation is a nontrivial task, particularly when, as is often the case, cluster sampling is accompanied by unequal probabilities of selection, necessitating case weights. Thus, multiple imputation often ignores complex sample designs and assumes simple random sampling when generating imputations, even though failing to account for complex sample design features is known to yield biased estimates and confidence intervals that have incorrect nominal coverage. In this article, we extend a recently developed, weighted, finite-population Bayesian bootstrap procedure to generate synthetic populations conditional on complex sample design data that can be treated as simple random samples at the imputation stage, obviating the need to directly model design features for imputation. We develop two forms of this method: one where the probabilities of selection are known at the first and second stages of the design, and the other, more common in public use files, where only the final weight based on the product of the two probabilities is known. We show that this method has advantages in terms of bias, mean square error, and coverage properties over methods where sample designs are ignored, with little loss in efficiency, even when compared with correct fully parametric models. An application is made using the National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System, a multistage, unequal probability sample of U.S. passenger vehicle crashes, which suffers from a substantial amount of missing data in “Delta-V,” a key crash severity measure.},

 abstract = {When an investigator records an observation by nature according to a certain stochastic model, the recorded observation will not have the original distribution unless every observation is given an equal chance of being recorded. A number of papers have appeared during the last ten years implicitly using the concepts of weighted and size-biased sampling distributions. In this paper, we examine some general models leading to weighted distributions with weight functions not necessarily bounded by unity. The examples include: probability sampling in sample surveys, additive damage models, visibility bias dependent on the nature of data collection and two-stage sampling. Several important distributions and their size-biased forms are recorded. A few theorems are given on the inequalities between the mean values of two weighted distributions. The results are applied to the analysis of data relating to human populations and wildlife management. For human populations, the following is raised and discussed: Let us ascertain from each male student in a class the number of brothers, including himself, and sisters he has and denote by k the number of students and by B and S the total numbers of brothers and sisters. What would be the approximate values of B/(B + S), the ratio of brothers to the total number of children, and (B + S)/k, the average number of children per family? It is shown that B/(B + S) will be an overestimate of the proportion of boys among the children per family in the general population which is about half, and similarly (B + S)/k is biased upwards as an estimate of the average number of children per family in the general population. Some suggestions are offered for the estimation of these population parameters. Lastly, for the purpose of estimating wildlife population density, certain results are formulated within the framework of quadrat sampling involving visibility bias.},
